1 Project Summary

Carbon certification is committed to building blockchain open technology, decentralized resource-based vertical industry backbone. By introducing resource holders such as economic forests and timber forests, forest demanders such as processing plants and investors, as well as insurers, transporters and other industrial service providers, to build a transparent, credible and decentralized forest ecological chain. In recent years, the global forestry resources survey and development has been rapid but the overall industry development has slowed down. The fundamental reason is that the opaque information in the middle and middle layers leads to inefficient value transmission. The forestry industry chain is too long and global, and it is difficult for downstream manufacturers to directly obtain upstream information and traceable forest sources. It is difficult to establish and maintain market trust relationships. Only the head enterprises in the industry have the corresponding funds and capabilities for a new round of development and expansion. However, due to the long return period and high barriers to entry, resource holders are solely responsible for all risks and unfavorable situations, resulting in banks, credit and other funds are reluctant to provide corresponding support. Incremental funds are limited in the industry, and resource operators are facing financial constraints. Even the dilemma of the break. Impede the further development of the industry. In addition, due to the asymmetry of product quality and the high price of sales, the status quo is infringing and damaging the interests of downstream enterprises and investors. The purchasing enthusiasm is declining, and downstream demand cannot promote the development of the upstream industry.
Nowadays, carbon certification innovatively uses blockchain technology to solve industrial pain points. By constructing a credible and transparent environment, resources need to record all forest information and data through witnesses in the blockchain. Investors can query and obtain corresponding Forest information, the credit evaluation system of various service providers in the industry will also be visible to all. Through the unchangeable characteristics of the blockchain and the transparent evaluation system of the community users, the real and effective and inferior enterprises of the guarantee information are expelled. The carbon certification program issues CEC vouchers as a “voucher resource” in the ecology. When ecological participants conduct information chaining, trading, and investment crowdfunding in the ecology, all transactions are paid in RMB or other legal currency, but in the system. The service provider will use CEC credentials to perform the process of recording relevant information to the blockchain. Eco-related service providers can develop and access their own DAPP through mortgage CEC to enrich their ecological applications and scenarios. With the improvement of ecology and the increase in the number of participating users, the value of CEC will increase accordingly. Early participants holding CEC gained more equity and voucher appreciation gains.

2 Market analysis

2.1 Status of China's forestry market

The resource industry is a carrier of resource economic activities and a collection of enterprises engaged in economic activities such as production and reproduction of resources. Currently, the most developed areas of the global forestry economy are concentrated in Asia. For example, forestry development in Southeast Asia is quite prosperous, especially in the forest industry, which plays a vital role in its national economy and is also a leader in the world. Forestry is not only an important basic industry, but also an important public welfare undertaking.
The development of forestry in Asia has been accelerating, ecological construction and protection have been further strengthened, people's livelihood and infrastructure in the forest areas have been significantly improved, and various achievements in forestry have made remarkable achievements and made significant contributions to economic and social development. At present, people's ecological consumption demand shows a sharp growth trend, which is driving the rapid development of the forestry industry. In 2016, China's forestry industry, including eco-tourism, sandgrass industry, woody grain and oil, bamboo and rattan flowers, biomass energy, wood processing, etc., exceeded 3.7 trillion yuan, accounting for 6.5% of the GDP of the year. Above, and the annual growth rate is about 20% for 10 consecutive years. According to the China Market Research Online 2017-2023 China Forestry Industry Status Analysis and Development Trend Research Report shows that in the long run, according to the objective requirements of economic and social development, To ensure a solid foundation for achieving the goal of 2020, the development goals of China's "13th Five-Year Plan" are: to complete 30 million hectares of new afforestation in 5 years, 35 million hectares of forest tending management (including low-efficiency forest transformation), and 12 billion trees for voluntary farming. . By 2016, the forest coverage rate will reach 21.66%, the forest stock volume will reach more than 14.3 billion cubic meters, and the total carbon storage of forest vegetation will strive to reach 8.4 billion tons. The ecological management of key areas has achieved remarkable results, and the national ecological security barrier has taken initial shape. The output value reached 3.5 trillion yuan, the proportion of featured industries and emerging industries in the forestry industry was greatly improved, the industrial structure and productivity layout were more reasonable; the ecological culture system was initially formed, and the concept of ecological civilization was widely spread.

2.2 The pain point in the forestry market

Due to inconsistent geographical conditions, the development of forest resources in different parts of the world is different, and the varieties and quality of forest trees are also different. Many high-quality forestry wood materials go global because of the opaque information and multi-layer intermediaries that are expensive and the uncertainty cannot be further developed. This regional limitation limits and hinders the interconnection of fine varieties worldwide. Interoperability has caused countries and even provinces to build cars behind closed doors and cannot support and promote the development of forest resources around the world. To realize the long-term development of the resource industry, countries all over the world must unite to solve the information asymmetry dilemma and promote the exchange of resources.

2.2.1 Supply chain system is opaque

The centralized forestry supply ecological structure breeds a large number of intermediaries that do not generate value and create obstacles for communication between resource providers and investors. In the past, forest prices lacked a fully market-oriented pricing mechanism, and information transfer between different levels of intermediaries became pricing. The key to the chaos of the entire forestry market price system is not conducive to the health and benign development of the industry.

2.2.2 Resource information is opaque

Due to the special nature of forest resources, ordinary investors cannot identify the basics of forest species and quality, forest sources and other basic information. In the industry, a small number of unscrupulous merchants and middlemen will use high-quality wood to replace decent investors to defraud investors and harm investors. Because investors lack simple and effective detection methods to judge the quality of products, the quality of some precious tree species still needs special identification agencies. The intermediate transportation links lack effective monitoring methods. Investors are in an information disadvantage position. A high crisis of trust.

2.2.3 Low value of circulation

The circulation of forest resources is extremely inconvenient, resulting in waste of resources and repeated execution of unnecessary procedures. With the advancement of the globalization of the resource industry, frequent resource transactions promote and promote the development of the industry. At the same time, due to the specificity of the resource industry, especially seasonal products, the marking of products is becoming more and more difficult. It seems that the initial period of commodity trading, the process of changing materials and the price target fluctuate greatly, repeated taxation, repeated testing, not only cumbersome, While causing waste of resources, it is extremely detrimental to the globalization of resource transactions.

3 ecosystem
The carbon certification ecosystem is mainly composed of resource providers, users, service providers and miners. Resource providers are providers of forestry resources throughout the ecosystem. They obtain certain economic benefits by selling or renting forestry resources. Timber merchants are the main investors and consumers in the carbon certification ecosystem. They can use legal currency or certificates to purchase and lease forest land. Or purchase other forestry services, and also holders of currency rights, can enjoy various types of currency rights; service providers are providers of forestry services throughout the ecology, providing forestry insurance, plantation detection, project crowdfunding, forest transportation, etc. The service of the series; each node is the maintainer of the entire carbon certificate, ensuring the stability and reliability of the carbon license operation.

3.1 Resource Provider

The resource provider is the provider of forestry resources in the carbon certification ecosystem, and is also a key link in the forestry resource industry chain. It plays a role in integrating and disseminating upstream information through docking upstream farmers and village collectives. With the carbon certificate, the resource provider records the forestry resources in the chain. After the downstream users access, they can directly obtain the forestry resource information, so that each forested tree data is transparent, reliable, and non-tamperable, while ensuring decentralization. Reconstruction of traditional forestry resources trading links.
Eliminate the cost of the middlemen and middlemen, realize the direct docking of the upstream and downstream of the industry, solve the complicated supply chain system in the traditional forestry resource transaction, and cause the price of the terminal consumer to rise sharply. Usually, the price of a forest tree may rise. Two to three times the ex-factory price, which reduces the sales of forest trees and hinders the development of the forestry resource industry. At the same time, it solves the problem of information opacity in the traditional trading model, avoiding the great opacity of resource information, investors can not distinguish some The authenticity of precious trees is deceived.

3.2 users

Users are issuers, investors, consumers and stakeholders in the entire carbon certification ecosystem. The carbon certificate will realize the record winding through the consumption of “voucher fuel”, and provide a better solution for the transaction credit problem. Each carbon certificate is encrypted and certified to ensure the information. Authenticity.

3.2.1 Trading scenarios

Each user in the ecosystem is double-encrypted, completing the transaction, leasing, and purchasing additional services provided by the service provider. The transactions completed by the user through the smart contract and the executed commands will eventually be recorded in the block, ensuring that the entire trading network is secure, transparent, traceable and non-tamperable. The user can purchase the resource provider through the asset chain on the exchange, and the certificate issued based on the value of the tree itself (ie the secondary certificate based on the carbon certificate development) can be divided into two types of certificates according to the forest assets, and one type of certificate is based on the timber forest. The voucher, the user purchases the corresponding voucher, that is, enjoys the income from the appreciation of the tree itself, and the return period is longer; the other is based on the issuance of the equity voucher, and the user can enjoy the economic benefits brought by the forestry active value after purchasing the voucher. The allocation is based on the proportion of the user's holding documents. In addition, users can also pay for the purchase of various types of financial and technical services provided by industrial service providers, such as forestry insurance, forest farm assessment, information release, tree species subscription, wood products trading, and service fees generated by wood processing. And a full range of supporting services.

3.2.2 Currency Rights

Carbon certification also encourages users to recognize the long-term value of CEC. CEC will enjoy multi-dimensional currency rights, such as platform dividends, 70% of the system's daily income will be transferred to the equity pool, and all CEC users will be recorded daily. The proportion is held, and the rights are distributed according to the user's corresponding currency ratio on the next day. In order to ensure the transparency of the data, the user's dividend mechanism will be completed in the form of smart contracts and recorded in the chain. The rest of the system revenue is used for certificate repurchase and system development and operation. Licensed users also have priority. First, users are eligible for priority purchases of rare species. Rare tree resources are often in short supply, so the platform will preferentially push information to users with a large number of days before the rare tree is put on the shelf. Users can confirm the purchase willingness and obtain the priority purchase qualification. The platform will give different users according to the number of days of currency hold. Different priorities. Secondly, the trading behavior of the currency-holding users can be preferentially automatically recorded in the ecosystem, and the transactions will not be confirmed or delayed due to network congestion or a surge in transaction volume. The holders of the currency can also enjoy rewards activities that are not regularly held on the platform, such as community airdrops, transaction deductions, etc., and users can get more benefits and benefits.

3.3 Service Provider

As a provider of carbon certification industry services, service providers provide a series of ecological services for eco-purchasing parties and resource providers to meet the diversified needs of merchants and users in the transaction process. Resource-oriented service providers can provide supporting forestry insurance for the resource side, such as natural disaster insurance, pest insurance and other comprehensive insurance, to protect the interests of the resource side, and complete the transaction and order execution through smart contracts to achieve automatic insurance payment. Effectively avoid insurance companies from accepting compensation through various means. The service provider can also provide forest surveying services. By introducing a team that has obtained more than 30 patented technologies, it can provide fast and accurate surveying and mapping solutions. In the past, it can only evaluate the information of the living area of ​​the standing timber, and estimate the specific quantity according to the proportion. The number of problems. At present, the multi-dimensional parameter indicators including tree number, positioning, tree height and canopy diameter can be obtained by surveying and mapping, providing more accurate and detailed data than before, and insurance service providers can formulate more accurate insurance plans according to the data. The eco-service provider can also provide wood processing services, and customize and design the wood according to the user's raw materials and processing ideas to meet the individualized and diversified needs of users. For better seamless access to existing forestry trading links, carbon credits are introduced to market makers who are responsible for converting the legal currency into the corresponding voucher to pay for the “voucher fuel” expenditure, which is the information-winding fee paid to witnesses in the ecology. In the traditional securities market, an independent securities brokerage firm with certain strength and credibility acts as a franchise dealer, and continuously reports the purchase price of certain specific vouchers (ie, two-way quotation) to the public investors, and accepts the public investors at that price. Trading requirements. In the carbon certificate, the trading behavior of the ecological participants can be paid in US dollars or other legal tenders. Each transaction needs to pay an additional fee to the market maker to convert into the equivalent fee for the transaction of the transaction information. The merchandise turnover will be transferred to the resource merchant account. The market maker is an ecological built-in service provider. Users and merchants do not need to exchange the voucher with the market maker, just choose to pay/receive the legal currency or the voucher.

3.4 node miners

The online node provides computing power to ensure the stability of the carbon certification system. At the same time, the carbon certificate adopts the POS (Casper) consensus mechanism to encourage more users to participate in the rights enhancement. Casper is a margin-based economic incentive consensus agreement to solve the problem in the POS. The problem of interest, due to Casper's punishment mechanism, the illegal node not only can not get the fee through malicious attack on the network, but also faces the risk of the margin being confiscated, that is, raising the cost of illegal rights, encouraging healthy operation as an honest node to maintain the entire network. Security.

4 Technical mechanisms

4.1 Underlying architecture

The underlying technical framework of carbon certification mainly includes core modules such as resources, accounts and transactions. In the initial stage of system design, the system uses a new blockchain open mode to implement related functions, with the aim of focusing on the core business as much as possible. However, with the deepening of project design and the development of systems and communities, the platform will be open to multiple dimensions to better support the normal operation and benign development of the ecology. From the perspective of technical architecture, the overall structure of the carbon certification layer is divided into five levels: decentralized application layer (DAPP layer), contract layer, blockchain core layer, network layer and data layer. Among them, the DAPP layer mainly includes decentralized applications such as the eco-internal trading mall, and the ecological participants can also develop third-party DAPP on the platform and share all the resources of the open platform.

Application layer:

At the beginning of the application layer, the tree species certificate and resource trading platform are the core products, and various derivative applications in the industry will be derived in the future. Eco-participants can collect global forestry resource information and pay for the purchase of intent resources through platform enquiries. At the same time, the platform supports the development of various service and application products by the eco-service providers to achieve better application scenarios.

Contract level:

It mainly supports programmable smart contract modules. The industry often uses custom Turing complete virtual machines or mature programming languages ​​for contract writing. Carbon certification will refer to these architectures, design its own smart contract virtual machine and provide rich documentation for development. Applicable. As one of the mainstream technologies for the future blockchain, Oracle Language Machine will also support the rich smart contracts on the carbon card to provide a safe and reliable data source.

Core layer:

Includes account management, sharing protocols, consensus mechanisms, node management, and mining modules. It is the core of the architecture and supports the efficient and stable operation of the carbon certificate.

Network layer:

The P2P networking mechanism, data dissemination mechanism and other data verification gateway technologies are used to implement automatic networking functions to ensure efficient interconnection of blockchain networks.

Data layer:

Contains block data, ledger data, contract data, and the underlying preliminary design is based on IPFS for storage. IPFS is a global distributed storage system, which is very suitable for multi-center, point-to-point, high-frequency interactive application scenarios in the forestry industry. There is no upper limit to the performance. By constructing a decentralized ecosystem, the carbon certificate integrates the global forest information, industry services, and other forestry industry-related resource data, and presents the information on the platform DAPP.

4.2 Consensus mechanism

At present, Bitcoin has attracted most of the world's computing power. Other blockchain applications using the POW consensus mechanism have been unable to obtain enough computing power to protect their own security. At the same time, the block production of Bitcoin will be halved every year. In the near future, as the production of Bitcoin blocks is getting lower and lower, the power of miners will continue to decline, and the number of miners will be less and less. It is possible that the currency network will gradually become paralyzed (because miners have reduced the time to run Bitcoin clients, it is increasingly difficult to find a P2P node to connect and synchronize network data). Second, after a few years, with the decline in the number of miners, Bitcoin is likely to be attacked by some high-powered people or teams or mines, causing the entire Bitcoin network to collapse. POS (Proof of Stake): The mechanism of equity proof is a kind of calculation mechanism that replaces the workload proof by system rights to determine the block billing rights mechanism. Equity refers to the amount of documents that participants are willing to lock for a period of time. In return, the greater the user's equity, the greater the likelihood of becoming the next leader and choosing the next block. The POS consensus mechanism ensures the consistency and fairness of the system by constructing appropriate verification algorithms for the game model, and shortens the generation time and confirmation time of the block and improves the system efficiency. In the POS system, only the running node can discover the POS block and get interest. This has prompted many people who don't want to mine, and often open their own clients to keep node activity, which helps the P2P currency network to be robust. At the same time, in the POS system, even with 51% of the total network power, it may not be able to carry out 51% attacks. Because some of the money is not generated by mining, but by the interest generated by the POS block, this requires the attacker to hold more than 51% of the world's currency, which greatly increases the difficulty of 51% of attacks. The POS consensus mechanism introduces the concept of currency age (one dollar per day per coin) in the difficulty of SHA-256 hashing, making the difficulty inversely proportional to the currency age of the transaction input. In general, the age of the coin is defined as the product of the number of coins and the number of days the coin has, which allows the currency to reflect the monetary equity of the user at the time of the transaction. Once the currency's equity is used to sign a block, the currency age will be cleared to zero and you must wait for at least the corresponding currency age to sign another block. At the same time, to prevent very old or very large equity control blockchains, the maximum probability of finding the next block reaches a maximum after 60 days, a process that protects the network and gradually generates new coins over time without consuming A lot of calculations. In addition, the clear advantages of POS include security, reduced centralization risk, and improved energy efficiency.

 Economic security

The POW workload demonstrates the limited cost of power and hardware depreciation that miners can withstand, so there is a hidden cost of dynamic adjustment (through a 10-minute block). One of the main advantages of POS is the flexibility to explicitly design penalties for Byzantine behavior (ie, non-compliance). This allows the protocol designer to have more control over the asymmetric risk and return on revenue of various behaviors in the network. Another aspect of security is the cost of disrupting software and network sophistication, so the ability to have explicit penalties (possibly at a more severe level than POW) can increase the security of the network.

 Reduce centralization

To reach a consensus, POS equity proved to mitigate the impact of economies of scale. In the POW workload proof, in order to protect network security, relatively concentrated mine pools (such as AntPool) are more trusted than smaller ones. Large pools can reduce the unit cost of their technical and operational infrastructure (such as data center costs, electricity costs, personnel costs) by amortizing fixed costs in larger operations or by operating larger entities to increase price capabilities. . This means that two mines with the same cost will have different calculation powers, one can achieve higher computing power, and have a greater impact on the network, that is, money can generate money, for example, 10,000 miners dig separately Mines, each miner costs $1/min ($88.6 million/year), which is much less powerful than a mine that also costs $10,000/min ($87.6 million/year). However, in the case of POS equity proof, one dollar is one dollar. The advantage of this is that it cannot be integrated, making one dollar worthwhile, and it is impossible to develop or purchase an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is technically advantageous. Therefore, POS is different from the cumulative distribution of POW mining revenue, and uses proportional allocation (mature decentralized reputation/identity management services make it possible to distribute income proportionally).

energy efficiency

The POW workload proof mechanism secures the network by wasting resources. Bitcoin currently uses more than 20 TWh of electricity per year, which is close to the electricity consumption of the entire country of Ecuador. In order for Bitcoin to be used more widely on the scale of payments, it must waste as much power as a larger country. According to this development, the proof of workload may not be the right direction for development. It is worth noting that there are two costs associated with the issuance of POW. Internal costs are paid by miners and passed on to the currency holder. External costs, such as government environmental costs and subsidies (probably with cheaper electricity). In POS, consensus costs are lower (no power and hardware costs), allowing for low circulation. As the network matures, there may even be negative releases (combustion of online transactions, as well as fines and destruction) and a stable price. Therefore, not only can the energy consumption of the environment be reduced, but also a simpler structural design can be achieved. This is because lower energy consumption allows the potential economic cost loss (the risk of untrusted unrealized costs) to be replaced by the actual cost (electricity and depreciation costs are irreversible) to ensure the security of the network. This is a key underlying assumption for POS: actual costs and expectations of losses can motivate participants to protect the network. Therefore, although difficult, it is possible (and therefore better) to ensure the safety of the main chain by avoiding losses, which can reduce the public cost and deadweight loss in the system.

4.3 Smart Contract

Smart Contracts is one of the hallmarks of Blockchain 2.0. The carbon certification system is an indispensable part of Blockchain 3.0. In carbon certification, smart contracts mainly support multiple functions including identification, payment, and dispute system resolution. . Unique open system Any enterprise and developer can create their own terminals through open systems, open source sharing, membership synchronization, database sharing and other core programs.

4.3.1 Identification

KYC (know your customer) certification is required before any user or project party can use the payment function. Carbon certification will review the information through its own audit system, and will warn users who are not accurate. In order to ensure user privacy, only when the actual business occurs, the authorized party can access the corresponding identity information through the smart contract. For example, when a user is willing to purchase a resource forestry product, a smart contract must be signed before the identity information of the other party can be accessed.

4.3.2 Trading Process

Users search for the required products or services on the carbon certificate according to their own needs, such as forestry, financial insurance and so on. When the selected product or service is determined, the carbon certificate automatically generates the corresponding smart contract for the transaction based on the information of the transaction parties and the service registration content. Within one day of the smart contract generation, the user must pay the corresponding amount of legal currency or digital currency. After the service provider confirms the transaction, the platform will generate the corresponding purchase certificate and save it to the IPFS file system, and the two parties will finally get the corresponding purchase certificate. During the user's use of the service or product transportation process, the funds will be locked in the smart contract. After the service is over, the two parties will confirm in the smart contract, and the corresponding voucher or legal currency will be released into the account of both parties, and the transaction is completed.

4.4 Cross-chain technology

Because the carbon certificate adopts a multi-level blockchain architecture, the underlying support includes multiple chains such as private chain, alliance chain, and public chain. At the same time, considering the future and information interaction including many other main chains such as Ethereum and BTC, cross-chain Technology is necessary. Therefore, there will be a dedicated cross-chain team for cross-chain technology development, supporting the anchoring of data on multiple heterogeneous chains. At the same time, considering the booming development of encrypted digital assets in the future, the future will consider the development of asset exchange business units in the chain, thereby enriching the types of assets within the ecosystem.
4.5 Multi-tier storage model
Traditional blockchain platforms use file systems or NoSQL (such as LevelDB or RocksDB) for data storage on the chain. Based on the above data storage model, the carbon certificate will introduce IPFS technology for distributed encrypted storage of data. As a new point-to-point protocol, IPFS is expected to replace existing centralized protocols such as HTTP. Its fast download speed, reduced storage cost, security, and openness are ideal for many blockchain systems including carbon certificates. For carbon certification, the platform plans to store data with high access frequency and low security requirements on IPFS, users can quickly synchronize data, and use the carbon interface to develop DAPP, which greatly reduces the development cost of the application.

4.6 Privacy Protection

User sensitive information is stored in the private chain or encrypted in the IPFS network, and no one can crack it. The architecture considers the use of zero-knowledge proof for transaction security and privacy protection. For multiple technologies such as balance and transaction pipeline and alliance chain, resource integration through cross-chain technology not only ensures the efficiency of the platform but also realizes physical isolation and privacy protection of data. Etc., only the trading participants have access to and view. At the same time, for part of the funding data, the platform uses homomorphic encryption technology to avoid information leakage. In the entire network, based on the sensitivity level of the data, the composition of the user participants, and the transparency of the data, the main chain and the private use will be used.
5 voucher economy
The carbon certificate will fully utilize the rich ecological and voucher rights to stimulate the resources, service providers and investors in the entire forest ecology to achieve a win-win situation. By removing various types of intermediaries, we will greatly improve the transparency of industrial information and reduce transaction costs. Using the Proof of Equity Mechanism (POS), according to the proportion and time of each node's possession of the voucher, the difficulty of mining the nodes is proportionally reduced according to the algorithm, thereby speeding up the search for random numbers, shortening the time required to reach consensus, and improving the overall effectiveness.

5.1 Distribution plan

The total number of CEC carbon certificates is 76633937 . According to the calculation of the system, it is expected to produce 731 days.
The output of the room is 2 million pieces, and 500,000 pieces are used for promotion. The gift part is locked from the time of giving away.For 12 months, the gift part does not generate computing power and can be used for system consumption payment. The system does not make any private placement plan.

Technical team

Holding 100,000 pieces, this part is used for technical maintenance and development, and the lock period is unlocked for 24 months and four periods.

After 12, 18, and 24 months, the average amount of sexual unlocking is unlocked, and one quarter of each period is unlocked.

Operations team

Holding 1 million pieces, this part is used to pay for the operation and management expenses of the early carbon certification team.

Ecology

Holding 200,000 pieces, this part of the voucher is used to build a carbon certification ecosystem, and encourages all participants in the ecology to participate in ecological construction with a more positive attitude. The main part is used to stimulate the ecosystem to provide computing power. As a witness, the transaction information is linked to the chain, and at the same time, it is used to stimulate the activity of other participants in the ecology and community building behavior, such as holding dividends.

Fund institution

Holding 100,000 pieces, this part of the voucher is used as a project certificate held by the Foundation. The part of the voucher has a lock period of 24 months, is unlocked in four phases, and is averaged after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear unlocking, unlocking a quarter of each period. It is used to maintain the normal expenses of the Foundation, as well as the underlying technology research and development, ecosystem construction, strategic cooperation investment, maintenance platform and the standardized operation and benign development of service providers.

Environmental protection

Holding 100,000 pieces, this part of the voucher is used for environmental public welfare expenditures, supporting the promotion and organization of green charity organizations for public welfare tree planting activities and the conservation and management of artificial forests.

5.2 Usage scenarios

5.2.1 Native Application: Trading Platform

Trading System  

Terminal forest demanders (individual investors, timber wholesalers, processed timber companies, etc.) use any system currency to make payments during the transaction of forest trees and related products. The remaining service fees for system currency payments will be paid in the form of CEC. The calculation power system is used to pay the calculation cost corresponding to the transaction data, and the buyer can obtain the relevant forest rights digital certificate and related services. For example, forest rights certificate transactions, publishing of commercial information, wood products transactions, mall products, forestry eco-tourism, etc., the system automatically counts the service fees into CECs every day and assigns them to the witnesses in the ecology, ie node miners, and consumers receive corresponding Get the product.
Forward investment
As the world's first blockchain open system targeting forestry services, the carbon certification system will soon become the core of the forestry industry chain. Its distributed ledger and open resource sharing will generate trillions of equivalent service demand every year. All services in the system need to digest CEC as a computing fee, which inevitably leads to the value of the carbon certificate.

Dispute resolution system

If there is a dispute between the two parties during the transaction, the carbon-certified smart contract locks the record and the funds and corresponding products of both parties, waiting for the intelligent system to process and release the funds according to the arbitration result. For example, forest trading, etc., will be based on the evidence provided by the user, including the data (variety, origin, etc.) on the relevant forest ledger. It is analyzed and processed by the carbon certification intelligent system, and both parties will solve the problem after fulfilling the fair contract.

5.2.2 Derivative scenarios

Insurance service

Forest resources are greatly affected by changes in natural environmental conditions, and there is a large risk of fluctuations in related transactions and investments. As an important mechanism to enhance the forestry risk resilience, forest insurance not only helps forestry producers and operators to resume production quickly after the disaster, promotes the stable development of forestry, but also reduces the risk of forestry investment and financing, helps improve the forestry investment and financing environment, and promotes forestry sustainability. Management avoids risks. Resource holders have an urgent need to purchase corresponding insurance to reduce losses, but under the traditional model, insurers cannot accurately estimate the total value of resources, lack accurate measurement methods, and cannot provide high-value insurance services. The carbon certificate provides a visualized revenue estimation model by accessing professional insurers and providing them with resource information and past revenue data. Insurers can use this to estimate the corresponding insurance plan to protect the interests of both parties.

Equity crowdfunding

Equity crowdfunding refers to the crowdfunding method in which investors provide financial support for various projects to obtain corresponding rights. In the traditional forestry model, small investors cannot participate because of information asymmetry and do not dare to participate in the upstream investment in the industrial chain. The middle and upper reaches of the enterprise lack the corresponding funds to start technology research and development and achieve scale expansion. By creating a transparent and credible environment, small investors can understand the industry more comprehensively and make investment decisions to achieve higher return on investment. For example, eco-tourism project development, excellent variety research and development and other heavy asset projects can be initiated by issuing eco-participants to relevant projects, such as eco-tourism A voucher and raising corresponding funds to start the project. Investors can do according to their own wishes and financial strength. Make rational investment decisions in exchange for the corresponding equity pass. Once the project is successful, the project will enter the actual R&D or production process. Once it is successfully converted into a land-based business model, it will need to give investors the corresponding dividend income. In order to ensure the rights and interests of investors, relevant progress of the project needs to publish relevant data to investors on a regular basis. If there is a breach of contract, all assets will be frozen. The platform will issue all relevant evidence to the political and legal institutions to safeguard the interests of investors.

Logistics transportation

The transfer of forestry resources from the resource side to the terminal investor requires the support of logistics and transportation services. In the traditional mode, some intermediate transporters have bad behaviors such as stealing goods, but lack of effective monitoring means and opaque intermediate links, and high-quality transporters are also deeply affected by such vicious competition. Carbon licenses provide quality services to buyers and sellers by accessing quality transporters, and are screened by reverse evaluation of all traders in the ecosystem to remove vicious competitors. At the same time, all products obtained by investors can be traced to the source. With the intelligent coding of each tree, the relevant data (tree height, coordinates and other information of each tree) can be queried to realize safe visual consumption, avoid fraud and protect investor rights. .

5.2.3 Open System
Asia Forest Platform Block Chain Open System is a fully open system developed by the technical team after years of research and discussion. Any enterprise and developer can build their own unique service terminals through the open system. Apart from open API, Asia Forest Platform also opens resources sharing, member synchronization and database. Sharing and other core procedures.
5.3 How to get it

5.3.1 Trading in Transaction

The carbon certificate eco-certificate CEC will be circulated in the C2C fair market, and users can transfer and circulate through the C2C scene provided by the Asian forest trading platform, which is convenient and quick.

5.3.2 Calculation power reward

In order to ensure the system stability and information security of the carbon certificate, the efficiency of community decision-making is taken into account. The carbon certificate adopts the POS consensus mechanism. The ecological witnesses will maintain the stability of the system by contributing computing power, and will receive a certain number of CEC certificate rewards and corresponding information data and the “voucher fuel” fee paid by the transaction data. According to the characteristics of the POS consensus mechanism, the service costs generated by the forest trading ecosystem every day are fed back to the holders. With the original mechanism allocation, the daily rewards will be different. When creating a new node, the miner needs to create a “currency” transaction, which is distributed according to a predetermined ratio. The equity proof mechanism reduces the difficulty of mining the nodes according to the proportion and time of the credentials possessed by each node according to the algorithm, thereby speeding up the search for random numbers and ensuring good commercial scene support performance.

5.3.3 Community Incentives

The carbon certificate will give incentives to active participants in the ecology. Users who actively produce content, maintain community operations and provide development advice can receive CEC awards. Users with a higher node account level have the opportunity to receive occasional airdrop rewards. For example, the platform encourages users to share the evaluations of participating parties in carbon certification, reverse screening different resource providers, eliminate malicious participants, and build a credible and reliable ecology. At the same time, the platform will be rewarded according to the user's suggestability and creativity. The process will be judged by the community and the corresponding autonomy will be returned to the community.

5.4 Currency interests

5.4.1 Mortgage development

With the accumulation of forestry transactions, their demand will derive multi-dimensional needs from a single integrity transaction, such as eco-tourism, equity crowdfunding, and financial insurance. As the leading open chain of forestry, carbon certification encourages all kinds of services and product providers in the whole industry chain to settle in the open ecosystem, develop DAPPs for different scenarios and users according to product and service characteristics, and consider whether to issue applications for internal use according to actual needs. Chain certificate. In-house application development requires developers to hold and collateralize CEC vouchers. This is used to ensure developers' support and recognition of carbon certificates and the improvement and quality of the ecosystem within the platform, to avoid malicious developers developing malicious products, and Impair the interests of all parties involved in the ecology.

5.4.2 Priority

According to the user's currency holding days, the smart contract set by the platform gives the user different rights. In the carbon certification system, CEC is mainly used for the expenses incurred in the service fee process, that is, each time the information data is stored in the block, such as the data related to each tree (positioning, variety, height, etc.) after the initial standing timber is confirmed. Information storage, data storage and related credit data recording and storage for each transaction (current timber, fruit trading, long-term investment, equity crowdfunding, financial insurance, tourism products, etc.). For users with more money-bearing days, the mining union in the carbon certification community prioritizes the processing of its data records to the block, avoiding the inconvenience caused by data network congestion. In addition, the holders of the currency enjoy the priority of using the ecological limited activities and the internal testing activities, and obtain high return returns.

5.5 Locking system

CEC locks the warehouse, all the carbon purchasers of the CEC have a certain lock, every day according to the activity of the whole network, 0.5%-1% is not quantitatively unlocked in advance to become available (the available assets do not generate computing power), users The available assets can be sold at any time in the C2C scenario, and the price fluctuates around 2% of the effective price. After the user purchases, the system is re-locked, and only the locked assets generate effective computing power. The system allocates daily based on the amount of computing power per node user and team lock CEC.
